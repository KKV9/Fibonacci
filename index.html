    <h1>Fibonacci sequence</h1>
    <p>
      The fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the
      sum of the two preceding ones. e.g. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34. Start
      at 1, add the previous number (0) and get 1. Then, 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5,
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a visual representation of the fibonacci sequence drawn out as
      squares: <button onclick="drawSquares()" id="button1">Draw</button>
    </p>
    <div class="hidden" id="section1">
      <p>
        Each square, starting from the center, have side lengths corresponding
        to the fibonacci sequence. Note that the two previous squares have a
        side length equal to the proceeding square.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can draw an arc through each square to create a spiral:
        <button onclick="drawSpiral()" id="button2">Draw</button>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="hidden" id="section2">
      <p>
        This spiral is known as the Fibonacci spiral. It is closely related to
        the golden spiral, which grows by a factor of Phi (Ï†) every quarter
        turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pattern and proportions of the golden spiral are often found in
        nature. For example, seashells and flowers. Phi is an irrational number,
        approximately equal to 1.618... It is also called the golden ratio.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the numbers increase in the sequence, the ratio between the numbers
        gets closer to Phi. For example, 13/8 = 1.625... 21/13 = 1.615... and
        34/21 = 1.619... So, the Fibbonacci spiral is an approximation of the
        golden spiral.
